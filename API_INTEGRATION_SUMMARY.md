# API Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Flutter app with your backend API for authentication. The app now uses your custom API instead of Firebase Authentication.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `http: ^1.1.0` - For making API calls
- `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2` - For storing authentication tokens locally

### 2. New Files Created

#### Models
- `lib/models/user.dart` - User model to handle API response data
- `lib/models/auth_response.dart` - Authentication response model

#### Services
- `lib/services/auth_service.dart` - Main authentication service that handles:
  - Sign in API calls
  - Token storage and retrieval
  - Authentication state management
  - Sign out functionality

#### Widgets
- `lib/widgets/auth_wrapper.dart` - Custom authentication wrapper that manages app state

### 3. Modified Files

#### `lib/auth.dart`
- Replaced Firebase authentication with API calls
- Updated sign-in logic to use `AuthService.instance.signIn()`
- Disabled Google sign-in and sign-up (can be re-enabled with backend support)
- Added success callback to notify parent widgets

#### `lib/main.dart`
- Replaced Firebase auth state stream with custom `AuthWrapper`
- Added authentication state loading on app startup

#### `lib/account_page.dart`
- Updated to use API authentication instead of Firebase
- Modified user data display to use API user model
- Updated sign-out functionality to use API service
- Disabled profile updates (can be re-enabled with backend support)

#### `lib/home_dashboard.dart`
- Added callback support for sign-out events

### 4. API Integration Details

#### Sign In Endpoint
- **URL**: `http://192.168.1.105:8080/auth/signin`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "admin@compass.com",
    "password": "AdminPassword123!"
  }
  ```
- **Response Handling**:
  - Stores `access_token` and `refresh_token` locally
  - Stores user data (`user_id`, `email`, `full_name`, `role`)
  - Updates authentication state

#### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials on sign-in page
2. App makes POST request to your API
3. On success, tokens and user data are stored locally
4. App navigates to home dashboard
5. User data is displayed throughout the app
6. Sign-out clears all stored data

## Features Implemented
- ✅ API-based sign in
- ✅ Token storage and management
- ✅ User data persistence
- ✅ Sign out functionality
- ✅ Authentication state management
- ✅ Error handling with user feedback

## Features Disabled (Can be re-enabled with backend support)
- Google sign-in
- User registration/sign-up
- Profile updates

## Testing
To test the integration:
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
2. Start your backend server on `http://192.168.1.105:8080`
3. Run the Flutter app
4. Use the test credentials: `admin@compass.com` / `AdminPassword123!`

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Implement refresh token logic for automatic token renewal
2. Add user registration API endpoint
3. Add profile update API endpoint
4. Implement Google OAuth with your backend
5. Add proper error handling for network issues
6. Add loading states for better UX

## Security Notes
- Tokens are stored securely using SharedPreferences
- All API calls include proper headers
- Authentication state is properly managed
- Sign-out clears all sensitive data
